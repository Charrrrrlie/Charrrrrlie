**[update on 2023.12.19]**

ðŸŽ“I am currently a Ph.D. candidate of [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/) and [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) in a co-supervised project, under the supervision of [Xiao Sun](https://jimmysuen.github.io/) and [Xiaoou Tang](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/).

ðŸ“š **Human Pose and Motion** is my main field to explore.
<br> ~~Previously: 3D Perception in Autonomous Driving~~

ðŸ›° Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree at [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), supervised by [ZhenZhong Chen](iip.whu.edu.cn).

âœ¨I love to try something new, not limited in coding.

If interested, you can know me more on [my page](https://charrrrrlie.github.io/).
